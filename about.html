            I'm a bright, hardworking student that loves to learn new things,
            meet new people, establish authentic connections, and build cool
            stuff with technology. Technology has the ability to make people's
            lives better, and I love being a part of that.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not in class, playing board games with friends, or
            programming something new, I'm usually working with the Newman
            Catholic Ministry at UTD. As President of NCM, I lead a team of 12
            officers (13 including me!) in facilitating 8-15 hours of events
            each week. I firmly believe that a good leader is someone that
            embraces the intelligence and autonomy of their team and uses the
            individual strengths of each member to accomplish the common goal,
            and this is the model I use to lead NCM. Micromanagement is the
            antithesis of leadership; a good leader <i>inspires</i> their team
            so that they <b>want</b> to do a good job, and then
            <i>empowers</i> them so that they <b>can</b> do a good job.

          <h6>Intern - Technology</h6>
          <p>
            Designed and implemented custom syntax for Business Analysts to use
            to implement test cases of web services as part of the Business
            Lines Modernization department. This syntax (which could be read and
            written in plain English) serves as an abstraction layer so that
            non-technical employees can write test cases, while letting the
            software engineers implement the more technical part.

            Worked 50+ hours/week as a summer teaching fellow. I acted as a math
            teacher and mentor for a group of rising seventh-graders who will be
            in the first generation of their families to go to college. I gained
            valuable experience working in a team and interacting with parents
            from diverse backgrounds.
